# Insufficient Authentication Controls

- Usually MFA (even if they have it, PoC to bypass)
- High/Critical
- Even if I can’t get in, ask client


# Weak Password Policy

- Password Spraying indicates weak policy
    - Use deny-lists (rockyou.txt)
- Password policy may be public


# Insufficient Patching

- Moderate - low range usually
- Nessus is BFF here
- Could just be out-of-date


# Default Credentials

- Always check


# Insufficient Encryption

- Most common
- Nessus
- Weak Ciphers/Self-signed certificates
    - chances it’ll be exploited are low
    - requires mitm usually


# Information Disclosure

- Verbose error messages
- may give out domain info
- 404 errors will often give info
- Probably just watch video


# Username Enumeration

- Forgot password may say something different for correct username
- Just plugging in UN and PW
