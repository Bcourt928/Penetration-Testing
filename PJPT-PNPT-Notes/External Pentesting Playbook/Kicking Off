# Attack Strategy

- Think of an external test like home security:
    - more attention paid to the outside than inside
    - less RCE, more weak passwords (less likely MFA)
    - OSINT, OSINT, OSINT

# Vulnerability Scanning

- Nessus
    - Advanced scan
        - Discovery:
            - Host = default
            - port = 1-65535
            - Service = default
- OpenVAS

# Reviewing and Extracting Info

- Looking at Nessus
- Can export Nessus file
    - also generate pdf and html reports and executive summary
    - ******Look at Melcara Nessus parser (makes a report) (any nessus parser on GitHub)
