# Google Fu/Google Dorking

- A way to narrow results
- Google search syntax (will bring up a page of search syntax)
- site:<url> (brings up just that site
- site<url> -www (excludes what is after the minus)
- site:<url> filetype:<type of file> (shows only that file type)
    - used to look for potentially sensitive files
