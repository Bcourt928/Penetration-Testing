# Credential Stuffing and Password Spraying

Credential Stuffing:

- injecting breached account credentials
    - Get this from leaked credentials (like from breach parse)8
- Can use Burp Suite intruder/payload for this
    - Spinner or Pitchfork

Password Spraying

- Known usernames without a known password
    - Gather all useful username (hunter.io, OSINT, etc)
    - Test all usernames against one password
    - Most likely attacking against an Active Directory accounts which can be locked out
        - Best to ask to see how many attempts lock users out
    - Can use Sniper
- crackmapexec <protocol> (smb) <target_ip> -u <file> -p <password>
    - â€”continue-on-success

- Metasploit: smb_login
    - search smb_login
    - use 0
    - set rhosts <target_ip>
    - set user_file <file path>
    - set SMBPass <password>
    - set user_as_pass true
